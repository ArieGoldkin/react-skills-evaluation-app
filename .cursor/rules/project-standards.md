# Project Standards - React 19 Skill Evaluation App

## Project Overview

This is a React 19-based application that evaluates user skills through multiple data sources including personal information, Git repository analysis, and Google account integration. The app provides personalized skill assessments and AI-powered recommendations using a custom design system built on shadcn/ui.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Foundation

- **Authentication System**: NextAuth v5 with Google OAuth, JWT sessions, protected routes
- **Application Infrastructure**: Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript strict config, Tailwind CSS
- **Design System**: 15+ components with 418 tests, 89% compliance score
- **Database & API**: Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, comprehensive data models, CRUD APIs
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, Context API for app state
- **Theme System**: Comprehensive theme context with light/dark mode support

### ðŸ”„ Current Development Focus

- **Skills Dashboard**: Real data visualization with filtering and management
- **API Integration**: TanStack Query hooks with optimistic updates
- **Design System**: Theme-aware components and semantic color system
- **Component Architecture**: Client/server component boundary management

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript & React Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for all new code with strict configuration
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use composition over inheritance

### Component Architecture Rules

- **Component Size Limit**: Components must not exceed 180 lines of code
- **Component Breakdown**: When a component exceeds 180 lines, break it down into smaller components
- **Nested Components Structure**: For feature components that become too large, create a nested components folder and extract smaller components that are called from the parent component
- Keep files small and focused (max 150-180 lines)
- Separate concerns into different files and modules
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks or utility functions
- Split large components into smaller, composable pieces
- Create separate files for types, constants, and utilities
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) to organize related modules

### Function Complexity

- Keep function complexity low (max cyclomatic complexity of 11)
- Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions
- Use early returns to reduce nesting levels
- Extract conditional logic into separate functions when appropriate
- Prefer pure functions over functions with side effects

## State Management Guidelines

### Local State

- Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for component-level state
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Use custom hooks to encapsulate stateful logic

### Global State

- Implement Context API for simple global state (theme, user preferences)
- Consider Zustand for complex client-side state management
- Avoid prop drilling by lifting state appropriately

### Server State Management

- Use TanStack Query (@tanstack/react-query) for all server state management
- Implement proper query keys and query functions
- Leverage built-in caching, background updates, and error handling
- Use mutations for data modifications (POST, PUT, DELETE operations)
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
- Configure proper stale times and cache times based on data volatility

### TanStack Query Best Practices

- Group related queries in custom hooks (e.g., useSkillsData, useUserProfile)
- Use consistent, hierarchical query key patterns (['skills', userId], ['assessments', skillId])
- Implement global error boundaries and query-specific error states
- Use isLoading, isFetching, and isError states appropriately
- Always invalidate related queries after successful mutations
- Configure retry logic and offline behavior for critical queries
- Use TanStack Query DevTools in development for debugging

## Data Flow Architecture

```

               Custom Hooks (hooks/queries/)
                    â†“
            Component State (useState/useReducer)
```

## Performance Guidelines

- Implement proper memoization with useMemo/useCallback
- Use React.lazy for code splitting
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper loading states
- Use proper key props for lists

## File Structure Guidelines

## TypeScript Standards

- Define interfaces for all props and data structures
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing or `unknown`
- Create reusable type definitions in dedicated files
- Use generic types where appropriate

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test custom hooks with React Testing Library
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Maintain good test coverage for business logic

- Document all required environment variables

### Configuration Files

- Create .env.example files with all required variables
- Use proper naming conventions for environment variables

## Git & Development Workflow

### Commit Standards

- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused on single changes
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable

### Branch Management

- Use meaningful branch naming conventions:
  - feature/skill-assessment-ui
  - fix/auth-token-refresh
  - refactor/component-structure
- Implement proper branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews before merging to main
- Use squash merging for feature branches

### Code Review Process

- Require at least one code review for all pull requests
- Review for code quality, security, and adherence to project standards
- Test functionality before approving pull requests
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions

## CI/CD & GitHub Actions

### Continuous Integration Pipeline

- **Automated Testing**: Run all tests on every pull request
- **Code Quality Checks**: Implement ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks
- **Build Verification**: Ensure the application builds successfully
- **Security Scanning**: Run dependency vulnerability checks
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor bundle size and performance metrics

### Code Quality Gates

- **Test Coverage**: Maintain minimum 80% test coverage
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and alert on bundle size increases
- **Performance Budget**: Set performance budgets for key metrics
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated dependency update PRs
- **Security Alerts**: Immediate notifications for security vulnerabilities

## Design System Integration

- Use the custom design system (@skills-eval/design-system) for all UI components
- Follow the design system's component patterns and styling guidelines
- Ensure the design system is built before the app in CI/CD pipelines
- Maintain consistency with the design system's design tokens and components

## Code Generation Guidelines

When generating code, always:

1. Follow the established file structure and naming conventions
2. Implement proper TypeScript typing for all props and data structures
3. Use the design system components when available
4. Implement proper error handling and loading states
5. Add appropriate JSDoc comments for complex functions
6. Consider performance implications and implement memoization where appropriate
7. Ensure accessibility compliance with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
8. Write unit tests for new functionality
9. Follow the established state management patterns (TanStack Query for server state)
10. Implement proper security measures for user data handling

## Monorepo Considerations

- The project uses a monorepo structure with workspaces
- The design system (@skills-eval/design-system) must be built before the app
- Ensure proper workspace dependencies are maintained
- Follow the established build order: design-system â†’ app
- Use workspace-specific scripts for development and testing
