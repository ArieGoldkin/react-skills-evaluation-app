## Current Development Workflow

### Component Development Process

Follow the established workflow documented in `docs/tasks/component-task-template.md`:

1. **Research Phase** - Check shadcn/ui availability first, then Radix UI primitives
2. **Implementation** - Core functionality with TypeScript (max 180 lines)
3. **Testing** - Comprehensive test suite (90%+ coverage, 30+ tests typical)
4. **Documentation** - Storybook stories (12+ variations) and README
5. **Quality Gates** - Use `docs/tasks/component-checklist.md` for validation
6. **Progress Tracking** - Update `docs/tasks/current-progress.md` with completion metrics

### Current Quality Standards (Established Pattern)

- **418 tests passing** across 13 completed components
- **100% TypeScript compliance** (zero compilation errors)
- **WCAG AA accessibility** on all components
- **Complete documentation** (Storybook + README for each component)
- **Vitest testing framework** (fully migrated from Jest)
- **Component size limit** (max 180 lines per component file)
- **Function complexity limit** (max cyclomatic complexity of 11)

### Next Priority: Dropdown Menu Component

**Location**: `packages/design-system/src/components/navigation/dropdown-menu/`
**Dependencies**: shadcn/ui DropdownMenu integration, Radix UI primitives
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours following established patterns

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Component Architecture

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper component lifecycle management
- **Component Size Limit**: Components must not exceed 180 lines of code
- **Component Breakdown**: When a component exceeds 180 lines, break it down into smaller components
- **Nested Components Structure**: For feature components that become too large, create a nested components folder and extract smaller components that are called from the parent component
- This approach ensures proper separation of concerns and maintainability

### File Size and Separation of Concerns

- Keep files small and focused (max 150-180 lines)
- Separate concerns into different files and modules
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks or utility functions
- Split large components into smaller, composable pieces
- Create separate files for types, constants, and utilities
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) to organize related modules

### Function Complexity

- Keep function complexity low (max cyclomatic complexity of 11)
- Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions
- Use early returns to reduce nesting levels
- Extract conditional logic into separate functions when appropriate
- Prefer pure functions over functions with side effects

## State Management

### Local State

- Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for component-level state
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Use custom hooks to encapsulate stateful logic

### Global State

- Implement Context API for simple global state (theme, user preferences)
- Consider Zustand for complex client-side state management
- Avoid prop drilling by lifting state appropriately

### Server State Management

- Use TanStack Query (@tanstack/react-query) for all server state management
- Implement proper query keys and query functions
- Leverage built-in caching, background updates, and error handling
- Use mutations for data modifications (POST, PUT, DELETE operations)
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
- Configure proper stale times and cache times based on data volatility

## TanStack Query Best Practices

### Query Organization

- Group related queries in custom hooks (e.g., useSkillsData, useUserProfile)

### Query Keys

- Use consistent, hierarchical query key patterns (['skills', userId], ['assessments', skillId])

### Error Handling

- Implement global error boundaries and query-specific error states

### Loading States

- Use isLoading, isFetching, and isError states appropriately

### Mutations

- Always invalidate related queries after successful mutations

### Offline Support

- Configure retry logic and offline behavior for critical queries

### DevTools

- Use TanStack Query DevTools in development for debugging

## Data Flow Architecture

```
API Layer (lib/api/) â†’ TanStack Query â†’ React Components
                    â†“
               Custom Hooks (hooks/queries/)
                    â†“
            Component State (useState/useReducer)
```

## Performance Guidelines

- Implement proper memoization with useMemo/useCallback
- Use React.lazy for code splitting
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper loading states
- Use proper key props for lists

## Monorepo Architecture
