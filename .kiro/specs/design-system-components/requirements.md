# Design System Components - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for expanding the existing Skills Evaluation App Design System. The design system is already established with a solid foundation including:

**Current Implementation:**

- Package: `@skills-eval/design-system` (v0.1.0)
- Built on shadcn/ui and Radix UI primitives
- Storybook documentation setup
- TypeScript-first with proper type definitions
- Tailwind CSS integration with design tokens
- Component categories: ui, layout, forms, data-display, feedback, navigation

**Existing Components:**

- **Button**: Complete implementation with variants and CVA
- **Container**: Responsive content wrapper with size variants
- **Grid**: Flexible grid system with responsive options
- **AppLayout**: Main application shell with header/sidebar/footer

**Infrastructure:**

- Design tokens in CSS custom properties (light/dark themes)
- Utility functions (cn, utils)
- Testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library
- Rollup build system with proper exports
- Storybook configuration with essential addons

This specification focuses on expanding the design system with additional essential components while maintaining consistency with the existing architecture.

**Package Information:**

- **Name**: `@skills-eval/design-system`
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Build System**: Rollup with TypeScript
- **Exports**: ESM and CommonJS with proper TypeScript definitions
- **Peer Dependencies**: React 19, React DOM 19
- **Development**: Storybook on port 6006, Jest for testing

**Current Exports:**

```typescript
// Available imports
import {
  Button,
  buttonVariants, // ✅ Complete
  Container,
  Grid,
  AppLayout, // ✅ Complete
  cn, // ✅ Utility function
} from "@skills-eval/design-system";
```
