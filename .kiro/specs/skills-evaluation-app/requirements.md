# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Skills Evaluation App is a React 19-based application that evaluates user skills through multiple data sources including personal information, Git repository analysis, and Google account integration. The app provides personalized skill assessments and AI-powered recommendations using a custom design system built on shadcn/ui. The system aims to help developers understand their current skill levels, track progress over time, and receive personalized recommendations for skill improvement.
