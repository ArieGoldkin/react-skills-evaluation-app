# Skills Evaluation App - Project Overview

## What We're Building

The **Skills Evaluation App** is a comprehensive React 19-based platform that automatically evaluates and tracks developer skills through multiple data sources. The application provides AI-powered insights, personalized recommendations, and skill progression tracking to help developers understand their current capabilities and improve strategically.

## Core Concept

This isn't just another portfolio tracker. We're building an intelligent system that:

1. **Automatically analyzes your GitHub repositories** to understand your actual coding patterns, technologies used, and skill levels
2. **Provides AI-powered career guidance** through a conversational interface that knows your specific background
3. **Tracks skill progression over time** with visual analytics and evidence-based assessments
4. **Delivers personalized recommendations** for skill improvement based on market trends and your current level

### 📊 Intelligent Repository Analysis

- **Automated code analysis** that understands programming languages, frameworks, and tools
- **Commit pattern analysis** to gauge consistency and collaboration skills
- **Code quality metrics** that inform skill assessments
- **Evidence-based skill detection** rather than self-reported abilities

### 🎯 Skills Dashboard

- **Visual skills matrix** with 1-10 proficiency scales
- **Categorized skill display** (programming languages, frameworks, tools, soft skills)
- **Supporting evidence** from actual repository activity
- **Progress tracking** with historical data and trends

### 🤖 AI-Powered Guidance

- **Conversational AI interface** that understands your specific skill profile
- **Personalized recommendations** based on your current skills and career goals
- **Learning path generation** with structured roadmaps for improvement
- **Market-aware suggestions** that consider industry demands

### 📈 Progress Tracking

- **Historical skill progression** with visual charts and analytics
- **Achievement highlighting** when significant improvements occur
- **Baseline establishment** for future growth measurement
- **Activity timeline** showing recent coding activity and skill updates

- **Redis**: Caching layer and session storage

## User Journey

### 1. Onboarding Flow

1. User visits the application
2. Authenticates via Google OAuth
3. Connects GitHub repositories (optional but recommended)
4. System begins automated repository analysis
5. Initial skill profile is generated and displayed

### 2. Skill Discovery

1. System analyzes connected repositories for:
   - Programming languages used and frequency
   - Frameworks and libraries identified
   - Code patterns and best practices
   - Collaboration and consistency metrics
2. Skills are categorized and rated on 1-10 scale
3. Evidence from repository activity supports each skill rating

### 3. Dashboard Experience

1. Visual skills matrix shows current proficiency levels
2. Activity feed displays recent coding activity
3. Progress charts show skill development over time
4. Metric cards highlight key performance indicators

### 4. AI Interaction

1. Chat interface provides personalized guidance
2. AI understands user's specific skill profile and history
3. Recommendations consider current skills and career goals
4. Learning paths are generated with actionable next steps

### 5. Continuous Improvement

1. Regular repository syncing updates skill assessments
2. Progress tracking shows improvement over time
3. New recommendations adapt to skill changes
4. Achievement system recognizes significant growth

## Development Approach

### Quality Standards

- **Component size limit**: 180 lines maximum
- **TypeScript throughout**: No 'any' types, proper interfaces
- **Test coverage**: Minimum 80% for business logic
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Code splitting, memoization, optimized loading

### Development Workflow

1. **Component-driven development** with comprehensive Storybook documentation
2. **Design system first** approach using our custom component library
3. **Test-driven development** for core business logic with 89% design system compliance
