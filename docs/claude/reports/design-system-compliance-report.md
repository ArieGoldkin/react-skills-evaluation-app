## ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

### 1. Path Alias Consistency

**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Issues Found:**

- Input component uses relative imports: `../../../lib/utils`
- Text component uses relative imports: `../../../lib/utils`

**Recommendation:**

```tsx
// ❌ Current (inconsistent)
import { cn } from "../../../lib/utils";

// ✅ Should be (consistent with guidelines)
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
```

### 2. Component Size Compliance

**Priority: LOW**

**Analysis:**

- Button: 57 lines ✅ (well under 180 limit)
- Input: 133 lines ✅ (under limit but approaching complexity threshold)
- Text: 159 lines ✅ (under limit but complex)
- Card: ~80 lines ✅ (well under limit)
- Badge: ~90 lines ✅ (well under limit)
- Avatar: ~120 lines ✅ (under limit)
- LoadingSpinner: ~110 lines ✅ (under limit)

**Recommendation:**

- Monitor Input and Text components for future complexity
- Consider extracting hooks for complex logic if components grow

### 3. Missing Components Documentation

**Priority: LOW**

**Issues:**

- Input and Text components missing README.md files
- Some category index files are empty placeholders

**Recommendation:**

- Create comprehensive README files for Input and Text
- Follow Button README as template

### 4. Test Coverage for Complex Components

**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Component Test Coverage Status:**

- Button component test: ✅ Excellent (90%+ coverage)
- Input component test: ✅ Present
- Text component test: ✅ Present
- Card component test: ✅ Present
- Badge component test: ✅ Present
