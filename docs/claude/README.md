# Claude AI Documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Documentation Moved

**All Claude AI guidelines and instructions have been consolidated into the `.kiro/steering/` folder.**

This directory is maintained for historical reference only. For current guidelines, please refer to:

## üìç Primary Source: `.kiro/steering/`

- **Primary Instructions**: `.kiro/steering/claude-primary-instructions.md`
- **Project Rules**: `.kiro/steering/project-rules.md`
- **Quality Rules**: `.kiro/steering/react-typescript-quality-rules.md`
- **Design System**: `.kiro/steering/design-system-development.md`
- **Git Workflow**: `.kiro/steering/git-workflow.md`

## Why the Change?

The steering folder provides:

- Automatic loading with `inclusion: always` metadata
- Single source of truth for all AI guidelines
- Clear separation between rules (steering) and documentation (docs)
- Reduced duplication and confusion

## Legacy Content

The subdirectories here contain archived versions for reference:

- `guidelines/` - Development rules (now in steering)
- `quick-reference/` - Commands and checklists
- `reports/` - Historical compliance reports
- `templates/` - Code templates

For active development, always refer to the `.kiro/steering/` folder.
