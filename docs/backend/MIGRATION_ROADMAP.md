# Backend Migration Roadmap

## üó∫Ô∏è Strategic Migration Path: Enhanced Monolith ‚Üí Selective Microservices

This roadmap provides a data-driven approach to evolving your backend architecture. The key principle: **extract services only when justified by actual scale requirements**, not theoretical future needs.

## üìä Service Extraction Decision Framework

### When to Extract a Service

Use this decision matrix to determine if a service should be extracted:

| **Factor** | **Keep in Monolith** | **Consider Extraction** | **Extract Service** |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Request Volume** | < 500 req/min | 500-1000 req/min | > 1000 req/min |
| **Team Size** | 1-2 developers | 3 developers | > 3 developers |
| **Code Complexity** | < 500 LOC | 500-1000 LOC | > 1000 LOC |
| **Deployment Needs** | Weekly releases OK | Bi-weekly releases | Need daily/hourly releases |
| **Technology Stack** | Same as main app | Could benefit from different | Requires different stack |
| **Data Coupling** | Shared DB OK | Some isolation beneficial | Needs data isolation |
| **External Dependencies** | Few/simple APIs | Moderate complexity | Complex/rate-limited APIs |
| **Error Tolerance** | Failures affect main app | Isolated failures preferred | Must be isolated |
| **Scaling Pattern** | Scales with main app | Different scaling needs | Very different scaling needs |

### Extraction Score Calculation

**Score = (Request Volume √ó 3) + (Team Size √ó 2) + (Code Complexity √ó 2) + (Other factors √ó 1)**

- **0-10**: Keep in monolith
- **11-20**: Consider extraction, monitor closely  
- **21+**: Extract service

## üéØ Service Boundary Analysis

### Core Services (Keep in Monolith)

These services should remain in the monolith due to tight coupling and fast operations:

#### ‚úÖ **Skills CRUD Service**
- **Why keep**: Fast database operations (< 50ms), core business logic
- **Current state**: Well-implemented, minimal complexity
- **Decision**: Keep in monolith indefinitely

#### ‚úÖ **Categories Management**
- **Why keep**: Simple CRUD, rarely changes, tightly coupled with skills
- **Current state**: Stable, low complexity
- **Decision**: Keep in monolith indefinitely

#### ‚úÖ **User Authentication**
- **Why keep**: Security-critical, needs to be fast, tightly integrated
- **Current state**: Uses NextAuth, well-integrated
- **Decision**: Keep in monolith indefinitely

#### ‚úÖ **Dashboard APIs**
- **Why keep**: Aggregates data from multiple sources, UI-specific
- **Current state**: Fast queries, simple aggregation
- **Decision**: Keep in monolith indefinitely

### Services for Future Extraction

These services are candidates for extraction when scale justifies it:

#### üîÑ **AI/OpenAI Service** (High Priority for Extraction)
- **Why extract**: External API calls, rate limits, expensive operations
- **Extraction triggers**:
  - > 500 AI requests/day
  - OpenAI costs > $100/month
  - Need different retry/timeout strategies
- **Estimated extraction**: Phase 3-4 (Weeks 5-8)

#### üîÑ **GitHub Integration Service** (Medium Priority)
- **Why extract**: Complex external API, rate limiting, heavy processing
- **Extraction triggers**:
  - > 100 repository analyses/day
  - Background processing > 10 minutes
  - Need specialized workers
- **Estimated extraction**: Phase 4+ (Week 7+)

#### üîÑ **Analytics/Reporting Service** (Low Priority)
- **Why extract**: Heavy computation, different scaling needs
- **Extraction triggers**:
  - Report generation > 30 seconds
  - Analytics queries affect main app performance
  - Need dedicated analytics infrastructure
- **Estimated extraction**: Phase 4+ (Month 3+)

#### üîÑ **Notification Service** (Future Consideration)
- **Why extract**: Different availability requirements, multi-channel
- **Extraction triggers**:
  - > 1000 notifications/day
  - Multiple notification channels (email, SMS, push)
  - Need guaranteed delivery
- **Estimated extraction**: Phase 4+ (Month 6+)

## üîß Service Extraction Patterns

### Pattern 1: AI Service Extraction

#### Current State (Monolith)
```typescript
// packages/app/src/app/api/v1/ai/recommendations/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { skills, userId } = await request.json();
  
  // Direct OpenAI call from API route
  const recommendations = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "Generate skill recommendations..." },
      { role: "user", content: JSON.stringify(skills) }
    ]
  });
  
  return NextResponse.json({ recommendations: recommendations.choices[0].message.content });
}
```

#### After Extraction
```typescript
// packages/services/ai-service/src/app.ts
import express from 'express';
import { OpenAIService } from './services/openai.service';

const app = express();

app.post('/recommendations/:userId', async (req, res) => {
  const { userId } = req.params;
  const { skills } = req.body;
  
  try {
    const recommendations = await OpenAIService.generateRecommendations(userId, skills);
    res.json({ recommendations });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'AI service unavailable' });
  }
});

export default app;
```

```typescript
// packages/app/src/app/api/v1/ai/recommendations/route.ts (Updated)
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { skills, userId } = await request.json();
  
  // Route to AI service
  const response = await apiGateway.route('ai-service', 'recommendations', {
    userId,
    skills
  });
  
  return NextResponse.json(response);
}
```

### Pattern 2: GitHub Service Extraction

```typescript
// packages/services/github-service/src/types/interface.ts
export interface GitHubServiceInterface {
  analyzeRepository(repoUrl: string, userId: string): Promise<AnalysisResult>;
  getRepositories(userId: string): Promise<Repository[]>;
  syncUserRepositories(userId: string): Promise<SyncResult>;
  processWebhook(payload: GitHubWebhookPayload): Promise<void>;
}
```

## üìä Monitoring and Metrics

### Service Performance Metrics

#### Monolith Metrics (Current)
```typescript
// packages/app/src/lib/metrics.ts
export class MetricsCollector {
  static async recordApiCall(endpoint: string, duration: number, status: number) {
    // Record API performance metrics
    console.log(`API ${endpoint}: ${duration}ms (${status})`);
  }

  static async recordServiceCall(service: string, method: string, duration: number) {
    // Record internal service performance
    console.log(`Service ${service}.${method}: ${duration}ms`);
  }
}
```

#### Service Extraction Metrics
Track these metrics to determine extraction success:

| **Metric** | **Monolith Target** | **Post-Extraction Target** |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **API Response Time** | < 200ms (95th percentile) | < 150ms (95th percentile) |
| **Error Rate** | < 1% | < 0.5% per service |
| **Throughput** | Current baseline | 2x improvement |
| **Resource Usage** | Current baseline | 50% reduction in main app |
| **Deployment Time** | 10-15 minutes | < 5 minutes per service |

### Service Health Monitoring

```typescript
// packages/backend-core/src/monitoring/service-health.ts
export class ServiceHealthMonitor {
  private services: Map<string, ServiceHealth> = new Map();

  async checkServiceHealth(serviceName: string): Promise<ServiceHealth> {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${serviceUrl}/health`);
      const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
      
      if (response.ok) {
        return {
          status: 'healthy',
          responseTime: duration,
          lastChecked: new Date(),
        };
      } else {
        return {
          status: 'unhealthy',
          responseTime: duration,
          lastChecked: new Date(),
          error: `HTTP ${response.status}`,
        };
      }
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        status: 'down',
        responseTime: Date.now() - startTime,
        lastChecked: new Date(),
        error: error.message,
      };
    }
  }
}
```
