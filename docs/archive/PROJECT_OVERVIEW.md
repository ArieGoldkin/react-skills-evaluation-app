# Skills Evaluation App - Project Overview

## What We're Building

The **Skills Evaluation App** is a comprehensive React 19-based platform that automatically evaluates and tracks developer skills through multiple data sources. The application provides AI-powered insights, personalized recommendations, and skill progression tracking to help developers understand their current capabilities and improve strategically.

## Core Concept

This isn't just another portfolio tracker. We're building an intelligent system that:

1. **Automatically analyzes your GitHub repositories** to understand your actual coding patterns, technologies used, and skill levels
2. **Provides AI-powered career guidance** through a conversational interface that knows your specific background
3. **Tracks skill progression over time** with visual analytics and evidence-based assessments
4. **Delivers personalized recommendations** for skill improvement based on market trends and your current level

## Key Features We're Implementing

### 🔐 Seamless Authentication
